# Rethinking Saffir Simpson for Classifying Hurricane Landfall Events
The Saffir-Simpson scale is the most well known system through which hurricanes are rated based on the intensity of sustained winds within the storm. It is a simple system placing the storms into six numbered categories and is often the first statement made when talking about the potential impact of a tropical storm. However, as more landfall events occur, we are seeing that the intensity of the wind is not always indicative of the potential impact a storm may have. Hurricane Michael in 2018 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012 both caused approximately \$70 billion in damages to the continental US, but Michael was a Category 4 storm and Sandy was a Category 1 at their respective landfalls.
